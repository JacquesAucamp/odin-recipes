    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>150g unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>150g granulated sugar</li>
      <li>150g brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>300g all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>200g chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Preheat the Oven: </strong>Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan) or 350°F. Line a 
          baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
      <li><strong>Mix the Butter and Sugars: </strong>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened 
          butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.</li>
      <li><strong>Add the Eggs and Vanilla: </strong>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, 
          mixing until fully incorporated.</li>
      <li><strong>Combine with Dry Ingredients: </strong>In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking 
          soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined.</li>
      <li><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips: </strong>Gently fold in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.</li>
      <li><strong>Portion and Bake: </strong>Scoop spoonfuls of dough onto the lined baking sheet, leaving space 
          between each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the edges are golden.</li>
      <li><strong>Cool and Serve: </strong>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes 
          before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
